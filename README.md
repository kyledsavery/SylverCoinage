# Sylver Coinage
Sylver Coinage is a two-player mathematical game played on the positive number line and the purpose of this program calculates which player is in a winning position for manageable game sizes given initial conditions.. Sylver Coinage was invented by John H. Conway and is named after James Joseph Sylvester who proved that any number greater than (_a_-1)(_b_-1)-1 for some integers _a_, _b_ > 0 can be made as a linear combination of _a_ and _b_. The game is described in _Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays_ (1982).
